      <h1>Project Overview</h1>
      <p>This page shares links to the online tools we used in class. </p>

      <h2>Main Tools introduced:</h2>
      <p>cyberduck - files related to your website are transferred via ftp</p>
      <p>textwrangler - create html &amp; css files and create pages in a site structure. </p>
      <p>
        paletton.com - explore color options for your websites and find the hexidecimal
        equivalent of your chose colors. (ex: #990000)
      </p>
      <p>gmail.com - one email account to manage all site development info</p>
      <p>wordpress.com - best site to set up a very solid looking website/blog. </p>
      <p><strong>codeacademy.com</strong> excellent site to continue exploring coding!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>Monday, we did research and set up the computers with some applications
        (cyberduck and text wrangler). We also confirmed email accounts so that
        each person has acess during class. I helped them start with some research on
        a subject, and collect information to share on the sites they were about to
        build.
      </p>
      <p>
        I helped them start a folder on the server that they can continue to access
        from home on the mathplus server (up to a year, I believe).
      </p>
      <p>Tuesday-Wednesday, we focused on learning the very basic way html and css work.
        We learned to create style sheets and pages using Text Wrangler, and then using cyberduck
        to transfer files
      </p>
      <p><strong><em><a href="html-css-sample/index.html">Everyone now has some variation
        of this type of basic html-css layout.</a></em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>Thursday I introduced everyone to tumblr.com and wordpress.com. They are two
        free and excellent ways to build pages online while learning how to code, but
        offer very different ways to put your content into it and organize it.
      </p>
      <p>Friday I walked everyone back through the main tools, and made sure each
        person emailed a copy of their web account setup notes. These notes will include
        user/pswd info for each element we set up. I recommend that these accounts be
        deleted if each person neglects their online information after more than one month.
      </p>
      <p>If you are in need of assistance beyond what the free tools offer, I am
        available at negotiable rates based on work at hand. Send me a message through
        gmail. Learn more about all the aspects of my creative life, go to
